# Air Writing recognition application for Dyslexic people

The “Air writing recognition application for Dyslexic people” is a useful application which can be used to teach how an alphabet, or a digit is drawn or sounds like to the dyslexic people. To achieve air gesture recognition, existing systems rely on complex and expensive tracking setups. Most of the current systems, do not focus on helping dyslexic people. This paper shows how various technologies can be used to support the learning development of dyslexic people, in a cost-effective approach. This application is made with the combination of Machine Learning and Computer Vision technologies. Air-writing refers to writing characters in the air or the free space by the movement of the finger. "Air writing" is a multi-sensory technique that uses visual, auditory, and kinesthetic senses to help people with dyslexia. The air writing recognition system uses a computer's webcam to track “air gestures” made by the user, then classifies it into one of 36 classes: 10 digits, 26 letters.
